## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about the differences between images and background-images and how they impact the layout. I also used CSS variables so that it can be applied globally 

### Continued development

I want to improve more on how to adjust the size of the image.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Ordering_Flex_Items) - This helped me figure out how to control the order of content for medium devices.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/css3_pr_order.asp) - I found out about the order property from this website.
